# About Me

Hello, everyone! My nam'e Taylor, I'm currently living
in Oregon with my wife as we are finishing up school,
and we're planning on moving to Texas this spring with
our young family.

## About Me

I'm a Computer IT major with about a year left until I graduate. I started off wanting to specialize in cybersecurity, then thought about trying for vet school for a while, and now I'm back on the computer path, though I stil have a love for animals.

## Hobbies and Interests

I love the outdoors, and while Oregon has a lot to offer, it also rains wuite a bit here, which restricts outdoor activities during the winter time.  It certainly beats being snowed in for most of the year as we were in Rexburg though.


I think this should be a fun and educating class, and I'm excited to learn this semester with all of you!
